# Crumpsall Community Co-operative

Welcome to the Crumpsall Community Co-operative project! Our mission is to revitalize and sustain the Crumpsall Community Hall through community-driven efforts and co-operative principles. This website serves as a central hub for information, updates, and ways the community can get involved and support the initiative.

## Project Setup

This project is developed using modern web technologies and tooling to ensure a high-quality and maintainable codebase.

### Technologies Used

- **Vite**: For fast development environment setup and efficient build process.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling with a utility-first CSS framework.
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing to ensure the site functions correctly for users.
- **Jest**: For unit testing to maintain code quality and prevent regressions. (Unused at present)
- **Husky**: For managing Git hooks to enforce commit standards.
- **@splinetool/runtime**: For integrating Spline 3D animations seamlessly into the web experience.
